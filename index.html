                    There are multiple education systems followed in Pakistan. <br>
                    <ul><li><h3>Private Education System,</h3></li></ul>
                    <ul><li><h3>Government Education System,</h3></li></ul>
                    <ul><li><h3>Federal Education System,</h3></li></ul>
                    <ul><li><h3>Madaras Education System,</h3></li></ul> <br>
                    Some education systems followed the old curriculum, some were poorly maintained, some very expensive, un-updated, some were ruled by a corrupted government, and many more problems can be found in the education system of Pakistan.

The private education system is very expensive for the students of Pakistan. A lot of students cannot effort the expenses of private educational institutes. <br>

The government education system is poorly updated and followed the old curriculum.

Federal and foreign education systems are very expensive for the majority of the students of Pakistan. The majority of the people of Pakistan cannot afford the expenses of the federal and foreign education system. <br>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Madaras’s educational system is considered only to learn religious education. People think that in the Madares education system students only learn religious education and activities.

                    But actually, the Madares education system is the best in Pakistan. In the Madras education system, students learn the real meaning of life and the way of living a life.
                    
                    Also, the students learn practical life skills in the Madares educational system of Pakistan.

                    The transportation problem is one of the common problems faced by most Pakistani students. <br>
                    In Pakistan, most of the students faced transport problems, because in most of the areas the transport facilities are not available for them. <br>
                    They faced a lot of problems in reaching their study and education destination. They cannot easily reach their educational institutes. <br>
                    In most areas in Pakistan, one of the biggest issues is a traffic jam in the morning and evening. <br>
                    Many public means of transport are full of people, for students, it’s very difficult to get in public transport and reach on time to their educational institutes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes students climb to the roof of the public transport. Many times, the students get injured when they getting to public transport. <br>
                    Many schools, colleges, and universities also have their own transport facilities for the students but they charge a lot of money for the transport service.

                     faced a lot of financial problems in their student life. <br>
                    Education in Pakistan is very expensive and most of the students in Pakistan belong to a middle-class family, and for them, it’s very difficult to pay the high fee for getting an education. <br>                 
                    Enough resources are not available for the students, and students cannot buy the required resources for study and learning. <br>                                     
                    Books, notes, courses outline, transportation fees, and many other things required for their study and learning for which they need extra money from their parents and their parents can’t afford their expenses. <br>
                    
                    Some students work part-time jobs to support their study expenses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some students left education due to the high expenses of education and financial problems, and start working to support themselves and their families.

                    Financial problems are one of the biggest problems students face in their student life.
